## Getting Started with Big Bang and Browsers

#### General

Check out hello.html for a simple chat application.  You will need to modify hello.html and add some information about your application.

    //Add your application here the format is: [yourapplication].app.bigbang.io
    var bbHost = "";

Look for the bbHost variable and modify it to connect to your application. If your application was named test ( it isn't, this is an example ) you would use the following

    var bbHost = "test.app.bigbang.io";


You should be able to open hello.html in any browser.
